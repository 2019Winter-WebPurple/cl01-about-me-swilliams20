        <hr />
        <!-- this is the first paragraph that tells just a few basic facts about me -->
        <p> My name is Sarah Williams. I am 17 years old and I am a junior at Padua Academy. My birthday is September 30th, the same day as my mom! I have an older brother named Justin, a black labrador retriever, Griffin, and a cat, Mittens.</p>
        <!-- this paragraph talks about tv shows and movies my brother and I watched growing up -->
        <h4> Childhood Favorites</h4>
        <p> Growing up my brother and I loved to watch movies or TV together. We watched all kinds of stuff. Our favorites were <i>SpongeBob Squarepants,</i> <i>The Lion King,</i> <i>Brother Bear,</i> <i>Drake and Josh,</i> and <i>Wizards of Waverly Place</i>. We watched both of them over and over. Our favortie line from <i>Brother Bear</i> was when the Rams were fighting and they heard their echo and they thought it was someone else yelling at them to shut up. <q>Ram 1: Hey, shut up! [echoes] No, you shut up! [echoes] Ram 2: No, YOU shut up! [echoes] Ram 1: Hey, will you shut up?! [echoes] Ram 2: No! [echoes] Ram 1: Just SHUT UP! [echoes] [later] Ram 2: [tired] No, YOU shut up!... [echoes] No, YOU shut up!... [echoes] Uh...</q></p>
        <!-- this paragraph talks about what sports I like to play -->
         <h4> Sports</h4>
        <p> I <b>love</b> playing sports. When I was younger I played alomst every sport possible. Now I play softball and volleyball. I play travel softball all year round and I also play for my school. For volleyball, I play for my old school with a bunch of old friends.</p>
        <!-- this paragraph describes how I like the outdoors and what I do or what I did when I  was outside -->
        <h4> Outdoors</h4>
        <p> One of my favorite things to do is go outside. Since I was a little kid my family would always go on hikes or have bonfires outside. There is a creek in my neighborhood. My brother and I used to go down there all the time to go fishing, catch animals, or build a fort. We do not really go anymore, but every once in awhile, I'll convince him. My friends and I like to go for hikes, too. We always do stuff outside, sometime we even swim in the river. My dad and I like to take my dog for runs. We go to a school that has a huge hill in the back and we throw a stick for him and he loves it. When I was younger, all the kids in my neighborhood would play together everyday outside. Here are some of the games we played outside:</p>
